The RESTful API is built using the Express.js framework.

To begin, start the server with the "node app.js" command.

I used Postman to interact with the local file system.

Choose the HTTP method (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) according to the operation you want to check.
For POST and PUT requests, specify the content of the request body. Click on the "Body" tab and enter your data in JSON format.
For GET (one file), PUT, and DELETE requests, specify parameters in the URL, such as fileName.
